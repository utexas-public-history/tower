_Behind the Tower: New Histories of the UT Tower Shooting_ is the collective work of eleven graduate students and one History professor at The University of Texas at Austin. We came together in the Spring of 2016 to participate in a new course offered in the Department of History, The Public History Seminar. We studied various methods and forms of public history, but we focused on producing a public history of the mass shooting that Charles Whitman carried out at UT Austin on August 1, 1966.

The fiftieth anniversary of the shooting has produced more attention to these events than in the recent past, but we found that reliable historical treatment was lacking. Our goal is to use this website to open up a discussion of all the issues connected with the shooting, its context, and its aftermath. None of us is a specialist in this subject and we only had one semester to identify important problems, collect and analyze research materials, and write our essays. We want this website to raise questions, elicit curiosity, and encourage people to continue to dig into the history of what has to be one of the most important historical events to take place in Austin, Texas.
